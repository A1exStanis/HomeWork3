# Write a program that will simulate user scores in a game. Create a list with 5 playersâ€™ 
# names after that simulate 100 rounds for each player. As a result of the game create a list
#  with the player's name and score (0-1000 range). And save it to a CSV file. The file should look like this:

# Player name, Score
# Josh, 56
# Luke, 784
# Kate, 90
# Mark, 125
# Mary, 877
# Josh, 345
# ...

    for name in list_:
        score = random.randint(1,1000)
        scorelist.append([name,score])
